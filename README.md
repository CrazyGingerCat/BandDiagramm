# band-diagram

1D Plotter of band diagrams of various devices. Energy of conduction, valence, Fermi and vacuum levels are displayed as a function of the dimension of the device.
Voltage can be applied to single layers of material. The script is intended as a visual helper and results should not be taken quantitatively. I've made the following assumptions:
- applied voltage drops only at the interface between two materials, hence Fermi level is constant in bulk material;
- the existence of surface states in neglected;
- band bending occurs under full depletion region approximation, boltzmann smearing correction on the population at the edges of the depletion region
has not been implemented yet;
- metals are designed as semiconductor with zero band gap, high fixed electronic density (![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\inline&space;10^{23}) ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\inline&space;\text{cm}^{-3}))
, infinite DC dielectric constant;
